bedtools - a swiss army knife for genome arithmetic         
===================================================

**Current version**: 2.22.0

Note
-------
Stable release for bedtools were formerly archived on Google Code. Unfortunately, the Google Code
downloads facility is shutting down; so henceforth, all source code and stable releases will be 
maintained via this Github repository.

Summary
-------
Collectively, the bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. The most widely-used tools enable genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.

While each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted by combining multiple bedtools operations on the UNIX command line.


Performance
-----------
As of version 2.18, ``bedtools`` is substantially more scalable thanks to improvements we have made in the algorithm used to process datasets that are pre-sorted
by chromosome and start position. As you can see in the plots below, the speed and memory consumption scale nicely
with sorted data as compared to the poor scaling for unsorted data. The current version of bedtools intersect is as fast as (or slightly faster) than the ``bedops`` package's ``bedmap`` which uses a similar algorithm for sorted data.  The plots below represent counting the number of intersecting alignments from exome capture BAM files against CCDS exons.
The alignments have been converted to BED to facilitate comparisons to ``bedops``. We compare to the bedmap ``--ec`` option because similar error checking is enforced by ``bedtools``.


**Note:** bedtools could not complete when using 100 million alignments and the R-Tree algorithm used for unsorted data.
