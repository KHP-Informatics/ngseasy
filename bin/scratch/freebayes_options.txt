overview:

    To call variants from aligned short-read sequencing data, supply BAM files and
    a reference.  FreeBayes will provide VCF output on standard out describing SNPs,
    indels, and complex variants in samples in the input alignments.

    By default, FreeBayes will consider variants supported by at least 2
    observations in a single sample (-C) and also by at least 20% of the reads from
    a single sample (-F).  These settings are suitable to low to high depth
    sequencing in haploid and diploid samples, but users working with polyploid or
    pooled samples may wish to adjust them depending on the characteristics of
    their sequencing data.

    FreeBayes is capable of calling variant haplotypes shorter than a read length
    where multiple polymorphisms segregate on the same read.  The maximum distance
    between polymorphisms phased in this way is determined by the
    --max-complex-gap, which defaults to 3bp.  In practice, this can comfortably be
    set to half the read length.

    Ploidy may be set to any level (-p), but by default all samples are assumed to
    be diploid.  FreeBayes can model per-sample and per-region variation in
    copy-number (-A) using a copy-number variation map.

    FreeBayes can act as a frequency-based pooled caller and describe variants
    and haplotypes in terms of observation frequency rather than called genotypes.
    To do so, use --pooled-continuous and set input filters to a suitable level.
    Allele observation counts will be described by AO and RO fields in the VCF output.


examples:

    # call variants assuming a diploid sample
    freebayes -f ref.fa aln.bam >var.vcf

    # require at least 5 supporting observations to consider a variant
    freebayes -f ref.fa -C 5 aln.bam >var.vcf

    # use a different ploidy
    freebayes -f ref.fa -p 4 aln.bam >var.vcf

    # assume a pooled sample with a known number of genome copies
    freebayes -f ref.fa -p 20 --pooled-discrete aln.bam >var.vcf

    # generate frequency-based calls for all variants passing input thresholds
    freebayes -f ref.fa -F 0.01 -C 1 --pooled-continuous aln.bam >var.vcf

    # use an input VCF (bgzipped + tabix indexed) to force calls at particular alleles
    freebayes -f ref.fa -@ in.vcf.gz aln.bam >var.vcf

    # generate long haplotype calls over known variants
    freebayes -f ref.fa --haplotype-basis-alleles in.vcf.gz \ 
                        --haplotype-length 50 aln.bam

    # naive variant calling: simply annotate observation counts of SNPs and indels
    freebayes -f ref.fa --haplotype-length 0 --min-alternate-count 1 \ 
        --min-alternate-fraction 0 --pooled-continuous --report-monomorphic >var.vcf

   -f --fasta-reference FILE
                   Use FILE as the reference sequence for analysis.
                   An index file (FILE.fai) will be created if none exists.
                   If neither --targets nor --region are specified, FreeBayes
                   will analyze every position in this reference.
   -t --targets FILE

   -r --region <chrom>:<start_position>-<end_position>
                   Limit analysis to the specified region, 0-base coordinates,
                   end_position included.  Either '-' or '..' maybe used as a separator.
   -s --samples FILE
                   Limit analysis to samples listed (one per line) in the FILE.
                   By default FreeBayes will analyze all samples in its input
                   BAM files.
   --populations FILE
                   Each line of FILE should list a sample and a population which
                   it is part of.  The population-based bayesian inference model

                   ... for each region in each sample which does not have the

                   have support in the data.
   --haplotype-basis-alleles VCF
                   When specified, only variant alleles provided in this input

   --report-monomorphic
                   Report even loci which appear to be monomorphic, and report all
                   considered alleles, even those which are not in called genotypes.
                   Loci which do not have any potential alternates have '.' for ALT.
